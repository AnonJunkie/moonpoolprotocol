# MoonPool Protocol

**moonpool.finance**



## This Project is in beta, use at your own risk.

MoonPool is a new exciting experimental open source Defi project influenced by Yam and Sushi.
MoonPool project is created on Tron network - one of the leading Blockchain platforms. At this stage MoonPool is in beta experimental phase and MoonPool protocol is based on TRC20 token MFI

### What is MFI token?

MoonPool project is only experimental at this stage. The initial value of MFI token starts from 0. It is up to the community and miners to define its potential token value. You will need to install TronLink plugin to mine MFI, select different pools to approve and stake nominated tokens.
MoonPool is open source and verified on Tron.

### What is the total maximum supply for MFI token

Maximum supply for MFI is only 10,000. This cap is written in Smart Contract and immutable in MFI protocol.
MFI token is mined by staking other TRC20 tokens in MoonPools. Miners can unstake and withdraw staking TRC20 tokens anytime from MoonPool.. Total supply volume of MFI will never be over 10,000

### When will the pool begin?

MoonPool will begin at 2020–09–05 1:00 PM UTC .

### How long will the mining last for each pool?

For the first three pools, each pool has 20 days for mining since its start. Every two days, the minable MFI tokens will reduce in half for the next round. This is to encourage miners and communities to participate mining early on to get maximum rewards in MFI.
At launch, MoonPool will introduce 6 pools: JST, USDJ,PEARL,TAI,CRT are available for mining MFI token. USDT Pool is coming soon
PEARL/TAI/CRT pool has a maximum of 1,500 minable MFI over 20 days. JST/USDT/USDJ pool has a maximum of 500 minable MFI over 20 days.
MFI is distributed to each miner in the pool, the rewards amount depends on the individual’s staking amount and time, and the distribution amount for that round. We encourage miners to participate early to maximise rewards in MFI


### Will MFI token be listed on JustSwap?

Yes. We plan to launch it on JustSwap in the near future.

### How do I harvest and unstake?

Click the harvest and all your staked assets & earnings for that pool will be transferred to your TronLink address.

### Is there any additional fees?

You only need to pay a very small amount of transaction fee in TRX for calling MoonPool smart contract. MoonPool do not charge fees to people who participate in MFI mining.

### Does MoonPool developer get anything?

We are adapting the same model implemented by Sushi project. For the amount of MFI tokens being mined by community, there is also 10% of that amount minted for developer team to support future development of MoonPool ecosystem.

### Is MoonPool contract audited?

Currently MoonPool protocol is not audited. The contracts are open source and verified on TronScan. We are in process of contacting professional auditing teams to fully audit MoonPool contracts.As we mentioned, the project is in experimental phase. We have integrated some great features from other projects and libraries, and add our own ideas to create MoonPool contracts.So please take consideration and use it on your own risk.
